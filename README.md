Attempt to use python for stock trading

At one point I thought I might use python to help me trade in the stock market. Since then I have found other, more direct methods to be much more profitable. In fact, none of my algorithms prooved to be profitable. They might show promise at first, but then would loose me enough money in one day as to wipe out all of my profits and leave me worse off than I was before. I am happy to say that I am now a profitable investor and swing trader, but I did not do it with trading algorithms. Please do not use this for your self on a real money account. The alogrithm uses the broker, Alpaca, and Alpaca provides paper trading. Have fun trying it out that way and perhaps see if you can make modifications that may make it profitable, then use it to trade real money.
